# gallery-landing-page
The goal for this project was to design a landing page from scratch, and then code the design into a responsive web page using the user stories on FreeCodeCampâ€™s project requirements as guidelines.

The landing page includes: navigation at the top of the page with a hamburger menu appearing at smaller screen sizes, a place to sign up for the service highlighted at the top of the page, descriptions of the services offered, an overview of the pricing plans available, a video to engage the audience in the services provided, and a footer for additional information.
