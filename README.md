# gallery-landing-page
The goal for this project was to design a landing page from scratch, and then code the design into a responsive web page using the user stories on FreeCodeCampâ€™s project requirements as guidelines.

The landing page includes: 

* Responsive Layout
* Navigation at the top of the page with a hamburger menu appearing at smaller screen sizes
* Place to sign up for the service highlighted at the top of the page
* Descriptions of the services offered, an overview of the pricing plans available
* A video to engage the audience in the services provided
